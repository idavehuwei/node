// Similar to the other list types, you can use the arrow keys to navigate. To make a selection, you hit SPACE and can also select all with a or invert your selection with i.

// Unlike the other types weâ€™ve discussed, the answer for this prompt type will return an array instead of a string. It will always return an array, even if the user opted to not select any items.
